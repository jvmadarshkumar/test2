        Rides in amusement parks is a common example here the people are stretched out when 
the ride is turned on. The heavier the person the more amount of force the person 
experiences. As mass is directly proportional to the centrifugal force acting on a body
 
To create Artificial Gravity in training the astronauts. It can also be used to create 
artificial gravity in space. When the space station is rotating on an axis in space the 
objects in contact with the outermost part of the rotating station tend to stay in contact 
with the surface which makes that a floor to an astronaut who is walking.

Centrifuges in labs for separating substances such as DNA from blood or plasma from 
blood. These are small centrifuges with holders which can hold test tubes. 
Working: -
1. They are set to spin for certain amount of time or certain amount of spins. After 
spinning for a while the denser subjects gets separated from the solution and 
accumulate on the lower parts of the test tubes.
 
To launch objects into space instead of traditional methods to launch satellites into space
there are new inventions being made which are cost efficient and reusable compared to 
rockets these huge centrifuges are most cost efficient they work on electricity and no 
moving parts or parts that need to withstand high temperatures as in traditional rockets.
Working: - 
1. The first step is to load the payload into the centrifuge 
2. The second step is to suck out the air and make the centrifuge vacuum tight so that 
when the centrifuge is rotating at high velocity there would not be any drag or 
frictional force caused by air resistance.
3. In the third step the arm that holds the payload starts to gain extremely high 
velocity. All that velocity comes from kinetic energy produced by using electricity. 
It does not emit any waste like in traditional rockets.
4. After reaching a certain velocity which is up to Mach 10 the launch door opens the 
the arm releases the payload which will fly at the speed of 7,500km/h or 2.08km/s.
5. After crossing the atmosphere, the rocket engine would ignite and only a little fuel 
is necessary because most of the fuel in a rocket gets used up at the launch. But 
with the spin launch the launch is made easier and more payload can be carried 
with less fuel.
6. After releasing the payload the launch vehicle is returned back to the earth with 
parachuteâ€™s or any other convenient means
